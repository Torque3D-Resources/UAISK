		UAISK Overview:</h1>
	<h3>
		Although I've attempted to make this kit as complete and easy to use as possible, you have to remember that this is still "The Universal AI Starter Kit"
		not "The Completely Finished AI That Will Be Perfect For Your Game No Matter How The Game's Designed... Kit". You <b>will</b> have to make some scripting
		changes. You may just need a few tweaks (changing some of the variable values around and adding datablocks), or you may need
		to rewrite significant portions of the code; depending on your game's needs. Remember, the more original you want your gameplay
		to be, the more your script will probably have to be customized.
	</h3>
	<a name="Instruction2"></a>
	<h2>
		Games by Genre:</h2>
	<h3>
		In general, The Universal AI Starter Kit would work well in: action/adventure games, non-turn based RPGs, platformers, and fast paced shooters<br>
		<br>
		But likely wouldn't be as good in: tactical or stealth based shooters, turn based RPGs, fighting games, sports games (including
		racing), strategy games (RTS or turn based), or games that don't use combat AI (puzzle games, rhythm games, and simulations)<br>
		<br>
		Note: If you added in a cover system, this AI would work fairly well in a tactical shooter. If you made a few adjustments to
		enemy detection, this would work well in a stealth shooter.

	<h1>
		Creating New Markers:</h1>
	<h3>
		An <i>AIPlayerMarker</i> (referred to simply as a "marker" for most of this document) can be made in two different ways, by using
		the AI Marker Editor or manually.<br>
		<br>
		The recommended way is to use the AI Marker Editor. Press "<b>Alt A</b>" to open the AI Marker Editor. Read the tooltips and
		other editor text for help, it should be relatively intuitive; but if you require farther assistance, see <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction23"
			target="_top">the instructions below</a>.<br>
		<br>
		Manually placing a marker is done in much the same way as placing any other shape. The exact method differs slightly from engine
		to engine. Check your version of Torque's documentation for further details.<br>
		<br>
		Markers can also be placed within T3D prefabs if you desire.

	<h1>
		Setting Variable Values:</h1>
	<a name="Instruction7"></a>
	<h2>
		General Rules:</h2>
	<h3>
		The value placed on a marker overrides both the datablock's value and the overall default. The datablock's value overrides the
		overall default. The overall default is only used when no other value is given. Which makes the order: Marker's Value > Datablock
		Value > Overall Default<br>
		<br>
		No numbers can be negative or zero unless otherwise noted. Be careful when using values of 1 or less. Distances can use decimal
		point values (floats), but all other values should use whole integers only (ints). Don't stray too far from the default values;
		for example- if the default is 6, you probably shouldn't change it to 9006. Capitalization and the order you put the variables
		in shouldn't matter.<br>
		<br>
		When setting values on a marker, it's best to use the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction23" target="_top">AI Marker Editor</a>.
		To set values in a datablock or manually set an <i>AIPlayerMarker</i>'s value, use: <i>name = value;</i>

		Traits:</h1>
	<h3>
		If you plan on just using a stock version of The UAISK, then the traits system isn't very noteworthy. However if you intend to
		make extensive modifications to the AI or add in new behaviors, then the trait system can give you a lot more flexibility and
		freedom then you would have otherwise, as well as simplifying the code change you need to make.<br>
		<br>
		Traits are values given to a behavior that represent the properties of that behavior. Most of the stock traits are bool (true/false)
		values. The value of any of a behavior's traits can be changed dynamically and it will instantly change for all bots using that
		behavior.<br>

	<h1>
		Behaviors:</h1>
	<h3>
		Here is a list of the stock behaviors that come with The UAISK, as well as a brief description of how each one differs in the
		way it acts.
	</h3>
	<a name="Instruction11"></a>
	<h2>
		Aggressive Bots:</h2>
	<h3>
		All aggressive bot behaviors target, attack, and move in the same way. Here I'm only noting the major differences between them.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"ChaseBehavior":</b> After the bot has lost sight of or killed its target, the bot will stay around the area where it last
		saw its target alive. This is the default behavior.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"GuardBehavior":</b> After the bot has lost sight of or killed its target, the bot will attempt to go back to its spawn marker
		or path.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"TurretBehavior":</b> This is for stationary attackers. The bot will not move from its original spawn location, but will turn
		around on that spot.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"LeashedBehavior":</b> The bot can't move farther than a certain amount from its spawn marker. The bot always returns to its
		spawn point like in "guard" behavior.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"TeammateBehavior":</b> When not in combat, the bot will try to go back to a player on its team. If there are no players on
		the bot's current team, the bot will switch teams. Bots do not need to use the "teammate" behavior to be on the same team as
		players and other bots.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"PetBehavior":</b> This behavior acts in much the same way as the "teammate" behavior. The difference is that instead of just
		following the player around, the bot is actually leashed to the player; meaning that it can never be more than a certain distance
		away from the player.<br>
	</h3>
	<a name="Instruction12"></a>
	<h2>
		Non-Aggressive Bots:</h2>
	<h3>
		These are non-aggressive bot behaviors which can have scripted actions (such as dialogue and changing which behavior they're
		using). While in these behaviors, bots will not attack anything at all.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"NPCBehavior":</b> The bot cannot be killed.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"KillableNPCBehavior":</b> The bot can be killed.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"EscortBehavior":</b> The bot can be killed and will follow the player around.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"CritterBehavior":</b> The bot can be killed and runs from the player when touched. It can also pace far away from its marker.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"MedicBehavior":</b> The bot can be killed and will assist the player. It will then return back to its marker after it is
		done with its scripted action.<br>
		<br>
		When the player is within the bot's detect range, an event can happen (such as text popping up). Going outside of the bots detect
		range will make the pop-up close. The stock capabilities of this conversation system are fairly limited because <b>this kit's focus
			is AI, not dialogue</b>. All editing and additions are done through script. Please review the comments in <i>aiNPC.cs</i>
		to see how this system works. Note: This system was made for a game with only around a dozen lines of dialog. If you're making
		a RPG with significant amounts of dialog; this system may need to be changed. More than one non-aggressive bot in an area can
		cause text issues.<br>
		<br>
		To change what action a non-aggressive bot does when a player gets within its range, change the bot's <i>npcAction</i> setting
		to a different number. Listed below are the three default examples that come with The UAISK. As-is, they don't do much, but they
		should provide enough of an example to allow you to script what you would actually like to do.<br>
		<br>
	</h3>
	<ul class="List1">
		<li><i>npcAction = 1;</i> When in range, you will get a dialogue box asking if you wish to fight or not. If so, the bot will switch
			from a non-aggressive behavior to the "Chase" behavior and will begin attacking you.</li>
		<li><i>npcAction = 2;</i> A dialogue box pop up and three rounds of ammo will be added to the player's inventory.</li>
		<li><i>npcAction = 3;</i> This shows a simple cycle of text with yes/no options.</li>
		<li><i>npcAction = 4;</i> Displays a textbox and then heals the player back to full health. Only displays once you're in range of
			their weapon and if you have taken damage already.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		Creating and Modifying Behaviors:</h2>
	<h3>
		There are a variety of reasons why you may want to create new behaviors or modify existing ones. You may want different bots
		to have slightly different trait combinations than the stock version, you might want to have a few special bots that change their
		traits during the course of your game, or you may want to make a completely new, custom trait and use that trait in different
		combinations. But whatever your reasons might be, here's how you do it.<br>
		<br>
		To change what traits a behavior has, simply change the value of that trait within the correct behavior in the file <i>aiBehaviors.cs</i>.
		Of course that will change the way in which every bot that's using that behavior reacts. If you only want certain bots to react
		differently, you'll need to create a new behavior and set those bots to use the new behavior. To create a new behavior, simply
		copy and paste a behavior which you would like to use as a base, then change the new behavior's name and set the values you would
		like it to have for each trait.<br>

		Application Programming Interface (API):</h1>
	<h3>
		This section contains script commands that may be used by you (the developer) to perform a wide variety of different actions.
		These commands are for use in conjunction with your own custom code, so some experience with TorqueScript may be necessary to
		perform certain tasks with these commands.
	</h3>
	<a name="Instruction14"></a>
	<h2>
		Spawning and Killing Bots:</h2>
	<h3>
		Spawning and killing is done by either the bot's spawn group or team number.</h3>
	<pre>
AIPlayer::actionByGroup(%spawnGroup, %action);
AIPlayer::actionByTeam(%team, %action);
</pre>
	<h3>
		If the group or team is set to "all" then everything will spawn.</h3>
	<pre>
//Spawn all groups
AIPlayer::actionByGroup("all", "spawn");
//Spawn all teams
AIPlayer::actionByTeam("all", "spawn");
</pre>
	<h3>
		The "spawn" action always forces a new bot to spawn from each marker in the selected group, team or "all". This includes markers
		that already have bots associated with them. However, spawning two or more bots from the same marker can cause minor issues;
		such as causing some of the other actions to not work properly. Because of this, it is recommended that you use the action "unspawned"
		instead whenever possible, unless you specifically want more than one bot to spawn from the same marker for a particular purpose.<br>
		<br>
		You can also "delete" bots by group, team or "all". "Delete" both deletes the bot and stops it from respawning again.</h3>
	<pre>
//Delete group 1
AIPlayer::actionByGroup(1, "delete");
//Delete team 2
AIPlayer::actionByTeam(2, "delete");
</pre>
	<h3>
		You can "kill" bots by group, team or "all". "Kill" will cause the bot to die, playing a death animation, but it is able to respawn
		because of this.</h3>
	<pre>
//Kill group 1
AIPlayer::actionByGroup(1, "kill");
//Kill team 2
AIPlayer::actionByTeam(2, "kill");
</pre>
	<h3>
		"Stop" will stop all selected bots from respawning but will not immediately kill them; they must die naturally.</h3>
	<pre>
//Stop all groups
AIPlayer::actionByGroup("all", "stop");
//Stop team 3
AIPlayer::actionByTeam(3, "stop");
</pre>
	<h3>
		The action "unspawned" will spawn bots at all markers from that team/group that don't currently have a bot spawned from them.
		This includes bots that were killed using the "kill" action.</h3>
	<pre>
//Spawn all bots
AIPlayer::actionByGroup("all", "unspawned");
//Spawn all bots in team 1
AIPlayer::actionByTeam(1, "unspawned");
</pre>
	<h3>
		You can use the "inactive" get rid of all bots not currently engaged in combat. All idle bots in that group or team will be deleted
		and have their respawning stopped. However, bots that are actively engaged in combat will remain unaffected.</h3>
	<pre>
//Delete group 1
AIPlayer::actionByGroup(1, "inactive");
//Delete all inactive bots
AIPlayer::actionByTeam("all", "inactive");
</pre>
	<h3>
		The stock version of the kit's installation includes a "spawn all by group" action on mission load. This action can be commented
		out or deleted if you do not want that to occur.<br>
		<br>
		The actions are: <i>"spawn", "delete", "kill", "stop", "unspawned", "inactive"</i><br>
		And they can each be done by group, team, or "all".
	</h3>
	<a name="Instruction15"></a>
	<h2>
		Spawning at Objects:</h2>
	<h3>
		To spawn a bot using the same position and rotation as another object, instead of just using premade spawn markers, use the follow:
	</h3>
	<pre>
AIPlayer::spawnAtObject(%obj, %block, %delete, %path);
</pre>
	<h3>
		Where <i>%obj</i> is the ID number or name of the object you'd like the bot to spawn at, <i>%block</i> is the datablock you would
		like the new bot to use, <i>%delete</i> is a bool (true/false) value that represents whether or not you would like to delete
		the spawn marker after the bot has been spawned, and <i>%path</i> is the name of a path you would like the newly spawned bot
		to follow, if any. Other than the <i>%obj</i> value, all other values are optional. The object that you use will be deleted to
		make sure that the new bot does not occupy the same space as that object.<br>
		<br>
		The <i>%delete</i> value is useful if you don't want the newly made marker/bot to be saved. However, the marker will not be deleted
		if the bot that it spawns is set to use a feature which requires a marker, even if you request for the marker to be deleted.
		Note that if the marker is deleted, any <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction14" target="_top">spawning and killing actions</a>
		you attempt to use on the bot will not work properly, and some <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction12" target="_top">NPC
			actions</a> may not reset.<br>
		<br>
		The main purpose for this is to be able to replace one bot with another, because another bot can be used as the spawn object,
		but it can be used with any other object as well.<br>
		<br>
		Markers made this way that are not set to <i>%delete</i> will be saved when the mission is saved. Because you cannot add per
		marker variables to bots spawned this way, other than the <i>%path</i> value, make sure the datablock and/or default variables
		are set to the way you want the bot to behave.
	</h3>
	<a name="Instruction31"></a>
	<h2>
		Spawning at a Position:</h2>
	<h3>
		Much like spawning at an object, to spawn a bot at a specific position, use the follow:
	</h3>
	<pre>
AIPlayer::spawnAtPosition(%pos, %block, %delete, %path);
</pre>
	<h3>
		Where <i>%pos</i> is the position in world space you'd like the bot to spawn at, and <i>%block</i>, <i>%delete</i>, and <i>%path</i>
		work in the same way as they do for the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction15" target="_top"><i>spawnAtObject</i> command</a>.
		Other than the <i>%pos</i> value, all other values are optional. The value for <i>%pos</i> can be either a position or a transform,
		if you would like to set the bot's starting rotation as well. The <i>%delete</i> value has the same limitations as when using
		the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction15" target="_top"><i>spawnAtObject</i> command</a>.<br>
		<br>
		A few examples of what this can be used for include spawning a bot near the player (see the <a href="./Pet_Tutorial.html">Pet Tutorial</a>
		for an example) or spawning a bot at a random location. The <i>spawnAtPosition</i> command has the same limitations in regards
		to saving and pre-marker variables as the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction15" target="_top"><i>spawnAtObject</i> command</a>
		does.
	</h3>
	<a name="Instruction16"></a>
	<h2>
		Triggers and Items:</h2>
	<h3>
		The spawning and killing system allows for quite a bit of variation. Three of the many possible ways of using it are to have
		bots spawn on mission load (which is part of the default installation), have bots spawn using a trigger, and to have bots spawn
		using an item.<br>
		<br>
		A bit of setup is needed to spawn by a trigger (but the coding is already done for you). First, you have to place a triggerObject
		down. You can name it whatever you want, but you have to specify two variables:<br>
		<i>dataBlock = "guardTrigger";</i><br>
		<i>spawnGroup = (number);</i><br>
		<br>
		The trigger's datablock can be selected as you make the trigger from within the world editor. You should specify a spawnGroup
		for each trigger, and then add a matching spawnGroup parameter on each marker or datablock that you want to spawn from that trigger.
		Once that's done, comment out or change the group in the line of script: <i>AIPlayer::actionByGroup("all", "spawn");</i> in the
		function <i>startGame()</i> in the file <i>gameCore.cs</i>.<br>
		<br>
		By default The Universal AI Starter Kit does not allow you to spawn from an item. But here's an example of an item that will
		spawn group 1 when picked up; this is made for T3D 1.2.0:<br>
	</h3>
	<pre>
datablock StaticShapeData(AITriggerItem1)
{
    category = "AITriggers";
    //Change what shape is used
    shapeFile = "art/shapes/items/patch/healthpatch.dts";
};

function AITriggerItem1::onCollision(%this, %obj, %col)
{
    //Make sure a player picked up the item
    if (%col.getClassName() $= "Player" && %col.getState() !$= "Dead")
    {
        //Delete the item
        %obj.delete();
        //You can change the group number or what action occurs in the next line
        AIPlayer::actionByGroup(1, "unspawned");
    }
}
</pre>
	<a name="Instruction17"></a>
	<h2>
		Changing Teams and Spawn Groups:</h2>
	<h3>
		There can be an almost limitless number of total spawn groups, teams and members of each team and group. The team system also
		allows players and bots to be in any combination on any team. Team members can switch teams at any point in time without reloading
		or respawning. To change a bot or player's team after they have been spawned, use:</h3>
	<pre>changeTeams(%obj, %team);</pre>
	<h3>
		Where <i>%obj</i> is the bot or player whose team you'd like to change, and <i>%team</i> is the number of the team you'd like
		them to join. This can be used to join an existing team, or start a new team. For bots, this will both change the team of both
		the bot and its marker's team at the same time, to allow you to do an <i>actionByTeam</i> based on the bot's new team number.<br>
		<br>
		To switch a marker's spawn group, use the function:</h3>
	<pre>changeSpawnGroups(%obj, %spawnGroup);</pre>
	<h3>
		In <i>changeSpawnGroups()</i> the <i>%obj</i> variable is the marker and not the bot like it is with <i>changeTeams()</i>, and
		<i>%spawnGroup</i> is the number of the group you would like the marker to be apart of.<br>
		<br>
		Neither of these functions permanently change the marker's group or team. If you save and reload your mission after using these
		functions, the markers will still be apart of their original team or group. These functions are for a temporary change within
		a single mission.
	</h3>
	<a name="Instruction34"></a>
	<h2>
		Special Moves:</h2>
	<pre>AIPlayer::doSpecialMove(%obj, %time);</pre>
	<h3>
		The above function is used if you want the bot to stop all normal, automated tasks and just do one specific task that you tell
		it to do. The <i>%obj</i> variable is the bot that you'd like to effect, and the <i>%time</i> variable is the duration the special
		move will last, given in milliseconds. The function can also be called using:
	</h3>
	<pre>%obj.doSpecialMove(%time);</pre>
	<h3>
		An example of when this might be useful is if a bot was pushed or fell down somehow. You probably wouldn't want that bot to continue
		moving and firing their weapon as they're trying to get back up. So you would use this special move function during the duration
		that their "getting up" animation is playing to get them to stop those other tasks. Then after the given time has pasted, the
		bot will begin acting normally again.<br>
		<br>
		When a new special move is set, it will override the time on the previous special move. This can be used to have the bot start
		thinking sooner, or to keep it inert for a longer period of time.<br>
		<br>
		One thing to note is that you have to actually script the rest of the special move yourself. This is an advanced feature that
		is mainly for use by knowledgeable scripters and coders. For more about character animation scripting, <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction36"
			target="_top">check here</a>.
	</h3>
	<a name="Instruction41"></a>
	<h2>
		Explicit Movement:</h2>
	<h3>
		The explicit movement feature allows you to tell a specific bot to move to a specific location. However, this script feature
		will not work correctly under all circumstances because The UAISK's navigation system was not specifically designed for movement
		destinations to be set manually by players or developers.<br>
		<br>
		While the bots should have little trouble getting around one obstacle, if there are two or more obstacles between them and their
		destination; they might have a harder time. A harder time could mean getting completely lost, or just moving in a very long,
		suboptimal manner. Also the farther the distance, the less optimal their path will likely be; but in some cases, farther distances
		can help the bot to navigate around large or multiple obstacles.<br>
		<br>
		It is recommended that you use this type of explicit movement as little as possible in your game, and if at all possible, use
		waypoint based paths instead. Explicit movement should only be used for movement that is highly dynamic (such as being randomized)
		or highly dependant on the player's input (such as controlling the AI via mouse input). For movement to predetermined points
		and times (such as a scripted event), a waypoint based path should be used. And of course, normal movement for average situations
		should be controlled by the kit's premade automated systems, rather than set manually.<br>
		<br>
		The syntax for explicit movement is as follows:
	</h3>
	<pre>%obj.explicitAIMovement(%position);</pre>
	<h3>
		Where <i>%obj</i> is the name or ID of a bot and <i>%position</i> is the world coordinates for the location you would like that
		bot to move to. If the bot in question has a valid target, that bot will continue to go after that target rather than start moving
		to the specified position. Here is an example of this script's usage:
	</h3>
	<pre>allBotsGroup.getObject(0).explicitAIMovement(LocalClientConnection.player.getPosition());</pre>
	<h3>
		In the script above, <i>allBotsGroup.getObject(0)</i> is the first or only active bot that has been spawned, and <i>LocalClientConnection.player.getPosition()</i>
		is the player's position, assuming this game is hosted locally.
	</h3>
	<a name="Instruction42"></a>
	<h2>
		Start on Path:</h2>
	<h3>
		This command will force a bot to begin moving along a path.
	</h3>
	<pre>%obj.startOnPath(%path);</pre>
	<h3>
		Where <i>%obj</i> is the name or ID of a bot and <i>%path</i> is the name or ID of a path. If the bot in question has a valid
		target, that bot will continue to go after that target rather than to start moving along the specified path. If the bot is already
		moving along a path, this command can be used to make the bot begin to move along a different path. One possible use for this
		command is to make bots that enter a certain trigger start moving along a specific path, or even different or randomized paths.

	<h2>
		Path Alteration Scripting:</h2>
	<h3>
		For any number of reasons, there may come a time when you'd like to change a path in your game while the game is running. Here
		are a few functions that can be called from any custom script you create to help you do that.<br>
		<br>
		If you would like to reverse the direction which bots travel along a path, you can do so using the following command.
	</h3>
	<pre>
reversePathOrder(%path);
</pre>
	<h3>
		Where <i>%path</i> is the ID number or name of the path whose direction you would like to invert.<br>
		<br>
		However, reversing the path's direction while a bot is using the path can sometimes cause the bot to skip nodes; depending on
		where the bot is along the path when the reverse happens. But at other times, the direction inversion will occur without issue.<br>
		<br>
		If you would like to move the whole path at once by a certain amount, you can do so using the following command.
	</h3>
	<pre>
moveWholePath(%path, %offset);
</pre>
	<h3>
		Where <i>%offset</i> is the amount you would like each axis of the path's position to change by. And of course if you'd like
		to change the position of just one node, you can use the stock Torque command:
	</h3>
	<pre>
%node.setPosition(%pos);
</pre>
	<h3>
		Where <i>%node</i> is the ID number or name of the node whose position you would like to change, and <i>%pos</i> is the new position
		you would like it to be located at.<br>
		<br>
		If you would like to change the scale of a path, you can do so using the following command.
	</h3>
	<pre>
rescalePath(%path, %scale);
</pre>
	<h3>
		Where <i>%scale</i> is the percentage you would like each axis to be rescaled by.<br>

		Characters:</h1>
	<a name="Instruction38"></a>
	<h2>
		Adding New Characters:</h2>
	<h3>
		To be able to use different player datablocks or characters, a few things need to be setup properly. First, the model has to
		exist with all the necessary <i>.dts</i> and <i>.dsq</i> files. Second the new character needs to have a definition script; e.g.
		<i>player.cs</i> or <i>adam.cs</i>. Next that definition file must be called in <i>onServerCreated()</i> in
		<i>datablockExec.cs</i>. The example character that comes with the kit, and the recommend way to
		setup your character, is to use the player as a base. If you do this, a definition file doesn't need to be created because <i>player.cs</i>
		already exists. See the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction29" target="_top">FAQs section</a> if you need further help
		with basic character setup.<br>
		<br>
		Open <i>aiDatablocks.cs</i> and copy and paste all of the follow so that you have two of each of them (of course copy/paste the
		whole datablock and not just the name):
	</h3>
	<pre>
datablock PlayerData(DefaultPlayer : AIPlayerDataHolder)
</pre>
	<h3>
		In the datablock name above you'll see that it has "DefaultPlayer" somewhere in the name. Change the word "DefaultPlayer" to
		another name that represents the new bot that you want to make. The name doesn't really matter as long as it doesn't have any
		spaces or weird punctuation marks.<br>
		<br>
		In the new version of "datablock PlayerData()" that you just made, change the <i>shapeFile</i> to point to the dts file you'd
		like to use. You can also change the value of any other <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction8" target="_top">per datablock
			variables</a> as needed; but none are required. Now simply set your datablock's name as the value of the <i>block</i> variable
		on your <i>AIPlayerMarker</i> and spawn the bot.<br>
		<br>
		In your new datablock you may notice that it uses a pattern like <i>datablock PlayerData(UniqueName : AIPlayerDataHolder)</i>. The
		<i>AIPlayerDataHolder</i> is a parent datablock that the new AI datablock inherits some of its settings from. By default the kit uses the
		player's datablock as the parent, but it could use another datablock or none at all if you give the AI datablock all of the needed
		settings; although changing the parent datablock is not recommended.
	</h3>
	<a name="Instruction36"></a>
	<h2>
		Character Animations:</h2>
	<h3>
		The Universal AI Starter Kit isn't directly involved with character animations, and in fact it is even abstracted from Torque's
		animation system. While keeping that in mind, at some point you will likely want one of your characters to perform a non-stock
		animation. If said character is AI controlled, you may have to add a bit of custom, animation related code to The UAISK. Because
		animations involve stock Torque features, custom coding, and a moderate amount of programming knowledge, but have little to do
		with The UAISK directly; these instructions will not go into the full details.<br>
		<br>
		However here are a few key, animation related script commands that are present in the stock version of Torque; just to help you
		get started.</h3>
	<pre>
%obj.playThread(%threadNum, %sequenceName);
%obj.stopThread(%threadNum);
%obj.pauseThread(%threadNum);
%obj.setThreadDir(%threadNum, %direction);
%obj.setActionThread(%sequenceName, %hold, %fps);
</pre>
	<h3>
		An animation thread defines what animation is playing at any given time based on the animation's priority and what type of animation
		it is. Animation threads can have a thread number of between 0 and 3, with 0 being the highest priority. Types of animations
		can include full body, lower body only, and blend animations. The sequence name is the name of the animation. Some stock Torque
		sequence names include "root", "run", "death1", and "jump".<br>
		<br>
		If you are interesting in adding non-stock animations to your AI characters, you should also check out the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction34"

		Weapons:</h1>
	<a name="Instruction20"></a>
	<h2>
		Using Multiple Weapons:</h2>
	<h3>
		When allowing a bot to use multiple weapons, the first thing you have to do is set which weapons can be used. You can do this
		by using the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction23" target="_top">AI Marker Editor</a> or by manually setting the <i>Weapon</i>
		variable. When setting the variable <i>Weapon</i> manually, separate each weapon's name with a space:</h3>
	<pre>
Weapon = "weapon1 weapon2 -noweapon -random";
</pre>
	<h3>
		The values <i>"-noweapon"</i> and <i>"-random"</i> can be used in addition to weapons' names. The value <i>"-noweapon"</i> will
		set the bot to not use a weapon, and <i>"-random"</i> will select a random weapon from any valid weapon datablock that is in
		your game. The same weapon can be added to the <i>Weapon</i> variable multiple times. The AI system does not have a limit for
		the total number of weapons a bot can use.<br>
		<br>
		The variable <i>cycleCounter</i> determines how often the bot changes, or tries to change, weapons; it can also have multiple
		values separated by spaces. If a value is set to <i>"X"</i>, it will be replaced with a random number each time that value needs
		to be used.
	</h3>
	<pre>
cycleCounter = "2 1 X";
</pre>
	<h3>
		The variable <i>cycleCounter</i> can hold an almost unlimited amount of different numbers in any mode. But, in general, <i>"Pattern"</i>
		mode is the only <i>weaponMode</i> that should need more than one number.<br>
		<br>
		Before equipping any new weapons, the bot always checks if its target is within the weapon's range (both min and max), and if
		it has ammo for that weapon; no matter what <i>weaponMode</i> the bot is set to. Currently there is no way for a bot to purposefully
		pick up new weapons and ammo. Because of this, it's recommended that you leave <i>$AISK_ENDLESS_AMMO</i> set to true, which will
		bypass checking the bot's inventory for the weapon's ammo. However if the bot happens to accidently collect a new weapon, the
		new weapon will be added to the end of the bot's weapon variable. If the bot has more than one weapon and its target is out of
		range of its current weapon, it will try to switch to a different weapon.<br>
		<br>
		The different <i>weaponMode</i> values are as follows:<br>
		<br>
		<b>"Pattern":</b> Goes in the order the weapons are in, starting over once the last weapon is used, or was attempted to be used.
		The <i>cycleCounter</i> goes in order, but starts over once the bot uses the last cycle or when the weapons are started over.
		If a weapon is skipped, then its corresponding <i>cycleCounter</i> value is also skipped (so that the pattern is always the same).<br>
		<br>
		<b>"Best":</b> The bot always tries to use the weapon that has the highest <i>weapRating</i> of the weapons on its list. The
		weapons are sorted by the function <i>sortBestWeapons(%shape)</i> whenever a new weapon is acquired. In <i>sortBestWeapons(%shape)</i>,
		<i>%shape</i> should be the bot. The <i>cycleCounter</i> always goes in order, only starting over once the last cycle is used.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"Range":</b> The bot always uses the weapon with the lowest range that is still within range of its target (both min and max
		ranges). If more than one weapon has the exact same range, it will use the latter one in its <i>Weapon</i> variable. The <i>cycleCounter</i>
		always goes in order, only starting over once the last cycle is used.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"Random":</b> The bot uses a random weapon from its <i>Weapon</i> variable. The <i>cycleCounter</i> always goes in order,
		only starting over once the last cycle is used.<br>
		<br>
	</h3>
	<a name="Instruction21"></a>
	<h2>
		Adding New Weapons:</h2>
	<h3>
		To be able to use new weapons, first your weapon needs to be setup properly:
	</h3>
	<ul class="List1">
		<li>The model has to exist.</li>
		<li>Script has to be made to handle the weapon; e.g. <i>crossbow.cs</i>, <i>SwarmGun.cs</i>, or <i>rocketLauncher.cs</i>.</li>
		<li>And that script must be called in <i>onServerCreated()</i> in <i>datablockExec.cs</i>.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>
		See the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction29" target="_top">FAQs section</a> if you need further help with basic weapons
		setup. Once you have your weapon working in general (test it using the normal, default player if needed), you need to make it
		work with The Universal AI Starter Kit. Set any <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction9" target="_top">AI specific per weapon
			datablock variables</a> that you wish to set; but none are required. Then simply set your weapon's name as the value of the
		<i>Weapon</i> variable on your marker or datablock and spawn the bot.

	<h1>
		Assisting:</h1>
	<h3>
		When a player or bot takes damage or dies, nearby team member bots can react if their behavior is set to assist. They will move
		to the injured's location and look around quickly. Bots will come to assist only if they are within the correct distance and
		can get to the location of their injured team member. You need to have both the behavior trait and the global variable set to
		the appropriate value, depending on how you would like each bot to react; as well as having the bot on the correct team of course.
		To increase the performance of your game, it is recommended that you have the minimum number of bots possible use this feature.<br>
		<br>
		The global variable <i>$AISK_CAN_ASSIST</i> is located in the file <i>aiGlobals.cs</i> and can be set to the following values:<br>
		1 = Bots can only assist players or bots following the player that get injured.<br>
		2 = Bots can only assist other bots that are injured.<br>
		3 = Bots can assist all players and bots that get injured. This is the default value.<br>
		All other values, such as 0, will completely disable assisting.

	<br>
	<hr class="Line2">
	<br>
	<a name="Instruction22"></a>
	<h1>
		Paths:</h1>
	<h3>
		If you wish to have a bot follow a path, first you have to place a path with nodes in your mission and give the path a name.
		Set the value of the bot's <i>pathname</i> parameter to correspond to the name of that path that you want the bot to move along.
		If you wish for the bot to be unpathed, don't add any value to <i>pathname</i> variable and the bot will default to being unpathed.<br>
		<br>
		A new path can either be created manually or by using the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction26" target="_top">AI Marker
			Editor</a>. To create a path manually (which is not the recommended way), consult the instruction manual for the version
		of Torque that you are using.<br>
		<br>
		If a path is not set to loop, then the bot will stop at the final node on that path. This feature, when used with trigger or
		item based spawning, can allow you to create scripted events (of course, you'll have to script said events yourself). If a path
		is set to loop, the bot will keep circling it until another action comes up (such as spotting a target). Make sure your paths
		have the <i>isLoop</i> variable set to what you want.<br>
		<br>
		The "Pause Time" field in the AI Marker Editor's Path Editor sets how long the bot will pause at that node. The value should
		be given in milliseconds. If you're not using the AIME path editor, the variable that sets the minimum time will be called <i>msToNext</i>.
		If you do not want the bot to stop when moving along its path, set the value of this to 0.<br>
		<br>
		For behaviors with the "returnToMarker" trait, the bot will attempt to return to its path after it has lost sight of or killed
		its target. For behaviors without the "returnToMarker" trait, the bot will stay in the area where it last saw its target. Non-moving
		or player following behaviors (such as turret, pet, teammate and escort) cannot be pathed at all.<br>

	<h2>
		AIME Overview:</h2>
	<h3>
		All AI bots are spawned based on an <i>AIPlayerMarker</i> (which is usually just called a marker). The marker is an object that
		is used as a placeholder for all of the bot's settings. These settings are applied to the bot when it is spawned. To help aid
		you when creating and adjusting these markers, The UAISK includes an editor called the AI Marker Editor (AIME).<br>
		<br>
		Press "<b>Alt A</b>" to open the editor. You can also add the AI Marker Editor to the "Edit" drop down menu in the world editor
		by doing the "Optional Custom Install Instructions" for the version of Torque you are using. For a video tutorial about using
		the AI Marker Editor, <a href="http://vimeo.com/7226158" target="_blank">click here</a> (Note: This video tutorial is now partially
		out of date). Also be sure to read the text and tooltips that are in the editor itself.<br>
		<br>
		The default AI Marker Editor should look similar to the following image.<br>

			of each page are <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction26" target="_top">below</a>.</li>
		<li>Deselect Textbox: If you have selected a textbox to type in a value, you will be unable to move using the keyboard and will type

		<li>Marker Selector: From here you can select which marker you would like to edit from a list of all previously created makers in
			the mission. When you select a marker with the AIME, it will also show up selected in the world editor if the world editor is
			open. When you select a marker, you'll see all of its values in the editor until you apply, or select a different marker. If
			the marker doesn't have a value on it, the editor will show the datablock's value; if the datablock also doesn't have a value,
			the editor will show the overall default value (which is exactly how values are determined when a bot is spawned).</li>

	<h2>
		AIME Object Creation:</h2>
	<h3>
		Marker, path and node creation and deletion can only be done from the "Creation" page. All other pages are only used for editing
		these existing objects or for supplemental tasks.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"New - From Selected":</b> When pressed, a brand new marker will be created. The new marker will be a clone of the currently
		selected marker, but it will be given a different name and placed using your current position and rotation. The existing marker
		that you wish to use as a base can be selected from the dropdown menu to the right of this button.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"New - Use Defaults":</b> When pressed, a brand new marker will be created. The new marker will be placed using your current
		position and rotation. The settings that are first used on this new marker will be from the selected datablock's values or the
		global default values, depending on which you have set. The datablock whose defaults you would like to use can be selected from
		the dropdown menu to the right of this button.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"Delete Selected Marker":</b> When pressed, the currently selected marker will be permanently deleted.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"New Path":</b> When pressed, will create a new path. A path can be selected from the dropdown menu to the right of this button.<br>
		<br>
		<b>"New Node":</b> When pressed, will create a new node on the currently selected path. This node will be placed at your current
		position. A node can be selected from the dropdown menu to the right of this button.<br>

			variable</a> at the top of <i>AIMarkerEditor.cs</i>.
	</h3>
	<a name="Instruction35"></a>
	<h2>
		Path Management:</h2>
	<h3>
		The tools on the "Path Management" page of the editor allow you to manage a path as just one object instead of having to make
		separate changes to each individual node that makes up that path. Changing individual node and path properties can be done from
		the "Path Editing" page.<br>
		<br>
		The "Clone Path" button will copy the path and apply the given offset to the new copy. Cloning makes a new copy of the path with
		copies of each node and uses the same properties for the nodes and path, plus an optional offset to each node's position. "Move
		Path" applies a given offset to each node on the selected path without making a new copy.<br>
		<br>
		The "Scale Path" feature allows all 3 axes to be scaled independently. Values are given as a percentage. The values can be positive
		to make the path larger, or negative to make it smaller. Zero can also be used to not have an axis scale. Values of less than
		-100 will flip the path inside out; because it's making the path more than 100% smaller; and -100 exactly will make the path
		into a dot.<br>
		<br>
		Scale can be given as just 1 value to have the path scale evenly in all directions. Given as 2 values, the path will scale on
		the X and Y axes only; or given as all 3 values for separate X, Y, and Z scaling.<br>
		<br>
		You can use the "Flip Path" button to turn over a path along its X, Y, Z or All axes.<br>
		<br>
		The "Merge Paths" button will take all the nodes from the selected path and add them to the end of a second selected path; and
		will then delete the first path which is now node-less. The second path is the one that is selected from the dropdown menu to
		the left of this button. <span class="Warn1">Warning:</span> Using the "Merge Paths" feature while the mission editor is open
		can cause your game to crash.<br>
		<br>
		The "Split Path" button will take all nodes after the given amount and move them from the original path onto a newly created
		path.<br>
		<br>
		The "Reverse Path" button inverts the order the nodes are in along the path. This will cause any bots to move in the opposite
		direction when traveling along the path.<br>
		<br>
		When open, the mission editor does not update the nodes' visual positions properly when using these commands. You may need to
		close and reopen the mission editor to see the nodes' correctly updated positions.

	<h2>
		AIME Pages:</h2>
	<h3>
		The AI Marker Editor has 10 pages. They are: Creation, Positioning, General, Distances, Weapons, Path Management, Path Editing,
		Actions, Globals, and Search
		<br>
		If you don't see the setting you're looking for on one page, try another. Check the editor's text and tooltips for help with
		any specific variables, or you can <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction8" target="_top">check here</a>.<br>
		<br>
		<b>&bull; Creation</b><br>
		Create and delete markers, paths and nodes. Further details can be found in the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction25"
			target="_top">AIME Object Creation</a> section above.<br>
		<br>
		<b>&bull; Positioning</b><br>
		When editing or creating markers; try to place them exactly on the ground/floor or as close to the ground/floor as possible without
		going under it. This can be done using the "Get Position" button in the editor. When the "Get Position" button is pressed it
		will change the marker's position to the current position of the player or camera; depending on which one you are using at the
		time. When you push the "Get Rotation" button, it will do the same as the "Get Position" button, only with rotation instead of
		position. The "Get Both" button will get both the player's/camera's rotation and position and set it to the marker once the changes
		are applied. Changing the scale of the marker will change the scale of the bot that is spawned from it. When making new markers
		on the "Creation" page, a "Get Both" is done automatically before the marker is made.<br>
		<br>
		<b>&bull; General</b><br>
		On this page you can find a wide variety of non-distance related variables and settings. The text towards the bottom of the page
		displays the ID number of the bot that is associated with the currently selected marker.<br>
		<br>
		<b>&bull; Distances</b><br>
		On this page you can change the various distance settings that the bot will use to navigate and attack when in your game. The
		distances are generally in order from longest to shortest.<br>
		<br>
		<b>&bull; Weapons</b><br>
		This page allows you to change the weapons that the bot will use and the way in which it will use them. If you select a weapon
		from the "Available Weapons" list, it will be added to the "Current Weapons" list. The "Current Weapons" list is what gets placed
		on the marker when you apply. You can click a weapon on the "Current Weapons" list to delete that weapon from that list. For
		more about weapons, <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction19" target="_top">check here</a>.<br>
		<br>
		<b>&bull; Path Management</b><br>
		From this page you can change the attributes of each node on an entire path at one time. Attributes that can be changed include
		scale, position, and direction. Further details can be found in the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction35" target="_top">
			Path Management</a> section above.<br>
		<br>
		<b>&bull; Path Editing</b><br>
		On this page you can edit the properties of paths and nodes that have already been created. The top portion of the paths page
		is for paths, the bottom section is for nodes on the selected path. When the "Get Position" button is pressed it will change
		the nodes position to the current position of the player or camera; depending on which one you are using at the time. Use the
		appropriate apply button for the object you are trying to edit. For more about paths, <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction22"
			target="_top">check here</a>.<br>
		<br>
		<b>&bull; Actions</b><br>
		On this page you can perform a variety of actions that will help you as a developer.<br>
		<br>
		It is important to give markers a unique name when creating new ones. Unnamed markers will automatically be named "MarkerXX",
		with XX being their number based on order of creation. However, if for some reason the markers' order gets mixed up, you can
		use the "Rename Markers" button to reorder them again. Giving each marker a unique name both avoids some minor issues and helps
		you when editing. Likewise the "Rename Paths" button will automatically name all of your paths as "PathXX" and the waypoint nodes
		on your paths as "NodeXX", with "XX" being there number in order.<br>
		<br>
		The "Hide Markers" selector will allow you to hide or show all markers as needed while editing. The "Display Name As" dropdown
		allows you to select if or how you would like the bot's name to be shown. <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction14" target="_top">
			Check here</a> for instructions on using the other actions that are on the bottom section of this page.<br>
		<br>
		Note: For some of the "Display Name As" options to work, you must have a <i>GuiShapeNameHud</i> enabled in your <i>playGui</i>.
		By default, <i>GuiShapeNameHud</i> is enabled.<br>
		<br>
		<b>&bull; Globals</b><br>
		On this page you can temporarily change the value of the global AI variables. No changes you make to the value of the global
		variables will be saved; this feature is only to help you when testing different settings. To permanently save a value you like,
		you must change the value of that variable in the file <i>aiGlobals.cs</i>. <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction28" target="_top">
			Check here</a> or <i>aiGlobals.cs</i> for more information about different global variables.<br>
		<br>
		<b>&bull; Search</b><br>
		Search for markers that contain certain values for certain variables. This can be helpful for levels with large amounts of markers
		with diverse settings. Global/overall values do not count in the results, however datablock based values do. The search is not
		case sensitive and will not get partial matches.<br>
		<br>
		You can select the variable you would like to be search through, the operation that should be used to search, and the key word
		or number that should be looked for. After the search button is pressed, it will tell you the number of results and list all
		markers that match your search. You can then select a marker from that list to have it selected throughout the rest of the AIME.
		The search results will still be displayed even if the editor is closed and reopened.<br>

		switch pages (but not markers) before you apply and any values that you have changed will be correctly saved when you apply.
		You need to apply changes once per marker. When applying, the editor adds as little information as possible to the marker itself.
		If you are setting a marker to have the same value for a variable as the datablock's or default's value, the marker's value will
		be set to blank. This allows you to change the datablock's value or the default value without having to edit all of your markers
		to see the result.<br>
		<br>
		The "Apply + Respawn" button will apply your changes to that marker; and then it will delete and respawn the entire spawn group
		of the marker you were editing. This allows you to see the changes you've made without having to reload the mission.<br>
		<br>
		"Apply Edits" and "Apply + Respawn" are only shown on the four marker editing pages; which are Positioning, General, Distances,
		and Weapons.<br>
		<br>
		The "Save Mission" button will save the mission whether or not anything has been changed; and it does not have a "save as" option,
		it will only do a normal save. <span class="Warn1">Note:</span> Because the AIME's "Save Mission" button helps to preserve your
		AI settings, it is recommended that you always use it whenever any bots have been spawned in your mission; even if you have only
		made non-AI related changes to your mission elements since the last time you saved.<br>
		<br>
		The "Spawn" button only appears at the bottom of the "Creation" page. When pressed, all unspawned bots will spawn.

		FAQs:</h1>
	<h3>
		<b>Q: Something isn't working right, what should I do?</b>
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> First make sure all files are executing and/or compiling properly. Then check the console log for errors. Then try
		reinstalling the kit again from scratch. I and many other people have successfully installed and used this kit based on my instructions.
		So your problem is likely caused by one of two things- you're trying to do a custom, non-default install; or you didn't follow
		the instructions properly. If you're not doing a custom install, please try carefully redoing all of the instructions multiple
		times before asking for help. The solution to your problem is most likely in the instructions and it's probably faster and easier
		for you to do so than to wait for a reply in the forum for help.<br>
		<br>
		If you still can't get something to work, be sure to be as detailed and clear as possible while asking for help (especially if
		you're doing a non-default install). Your post should include:</h3>
	<ul class="List1">
		<li>The version of Torque you're using.</li>
		<li>The version of The Universal AI Starter Kit you're using.</li>
		<li>What other kits, add-ons, customizations or modifications your test environment has. This means literally any changes at all;
			including free resources, kits you have purchased and custom coding that you have done yourself. This information is especially
			important because most problems are caused by code changes that have been made to Torque or the kit itself. If you haven't changed
			anything at all and are having installation problems, please use the quick install files that come with the kit.</li>
		<li>As detailed of a description of the problem as possible. Post any console errors you're getting and give steps to reproduce the
			issue if needed.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>
		Please read and follow the above when posting for help in the forum. If you don't give all of the information that's needed, people won't be able to help you.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Q: Why isn't my custom character model, animation or weapon working?</b>
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> Try using it as/with a normal, non-AI player. If it doesn't work properly as/with the default player; then the problem
		has nothing to do with the AI, and it's just not setup correctly. If it does work as/with the default player, try carefully redoing
		all of the related instructions multiple times before asking for specific help in the forum. Also try to have your new weapon
		or character's code resemble the stock code as closely as possible; try using a default weapon or character's script as a base
		for your own.<br>
		<br>
		Check the following links for general help with setting up a <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/products/torque-3d/fps/4-characters/1"
			target="_blank">player</a> or <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/products/torque-3d/fps/5-weapons/1" target="_blank">weapon</a>.
		If you are still unable to setup your player or weapon, do a <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/community/search" target="_blank">
			search</a> to see how to set it up correctly.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Q: My game needs a feature that isn't part of the stock kit. How would I go about adding it?</b>
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> If you need a feature that isn't already in The UAISK, then you're going to have to program it yourself or find someone
		else to help you, but that someone isn't me. As stated in the opening section of these instructions; the more unique you want
		your AI to be, the more you'll have to do yourself. And you're not entitled to hours of unpaid custom programming
		or technical support.<br>
		<br>
		The only AI files it is recommended you change are <i>aiGlobals.cs</i>, <i>aiDatablocks.cs</i>, <i>aiBehaviors.cs</i> and <i>aiNPC.cs</i>.
		Changes to any other AI files are not supported and need to be done on your own as custom work.<br>
		<br>
		There are a lot of great resources on GarageGames.com and I highly suggest <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/community/search"
			target="_blank">searching</a> through them to find what you are looking for. Most things that you'll think of have already
		been thought of (or at least something similar) and there's a decent chance a good resource for it already exists, if you're
		willing to do a bit of digging.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Q: Why isn't The UAISK working with this alpha/beta release of T3D?</b>
		<br>
		<b>A:</b> Alpha and beta versions of engines, by there very nature, are still changing, unstable, unpolished and likely lacking
		documentation. Because of this, they are not officially supported by The Universal AI Starter Kit and updates will only be released
		for new versions of T3D once they are stable and finalized. If you are unable to use the kit with an alpha or beta version of
		T3D without getting assistance, then you probably shouldn't be using that version of T3D yet.<br>
