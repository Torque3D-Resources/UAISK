		Introduction:</h1>
	<h3>
		This is a brief tutorial that will help you to setup a pet for the player. Before starting this tutorial, please make sure you
		have properly installed The Universal AI Starter Kit. If you have not done so yet, check the installation instructions for the
		version of Torque you are using.<br>
		<br>
		Keep in mind that this is a tutorial; it is meant as a learning tool and thus does not always do everything in the best, most
		efficient manner. This tutorial is for <i>T3D 1.2.0</i>.<br>
		<br>
		If you have not already done so, I recommend that you review the <a href="./Usage_Instructions.html">Usage Instructions</a> to
		gain a basic understanding of how The UAISK works before starting this tutorial.<br>
		<br>
		Part 1 has to be done in order to get parts 2 and 3 working. Parts 2 and 3 are optional; either or both of them can be skipped,
		depending on what features you would like.

		As always; the first step is to backup all files that are going to be changed. They are:<br>

			scripts/server/commands.cs<br>

		Now we're going to bind our pet spawning to key. This key binding calls a server side command named "SpawningAIPetHere".<br>
		<br>
		Check the code comments for more information. You may notice the start and end comments around the code, this is so you can tell
		what code has been changed later.<br>
		<br>
		File- scripts/client/config.cs<br>
		Add to the end of the file:<br>
	</h3>
	<pre>
//UAISK Pet: Start
//Make the "j" key call the server to spawn our pet.
moveMap.bindCmd(keyboard, "j", "commandToServer(\'SpawningAIPetHere\');", "");
//UAISK Pet: End
</pre>
	<h3>
		If you intent to use this code in your game, you should also paste the above code into the <i>scripts/client/default.bind.cs</i>
		file. If you're just using this tutorial as an example, then that should not be necessary.

	<h2>
		Part 1 - Step 3:</h2>
	<h3>
		Now we'll add the "SpawningAIPetHere" command that is being called by the key bind we just made. The command gets the player's
		current position and adds an offset to that position, so the pet doesn't spawn exactly on top of the player. After it has the
		final position, it then calls a function to actually spawn the AI pet bot.<br>
		<br>
		File- scripts/server/commands.cs<br>
		Add to the end of the file:<br>
	</h3>
	<pre>
//UAISK Pet: Start
//A server function called by the client to spawn a bot
function serverCmdSpawningAIPetHere(%client)
{
    //Get the player's position.
    %pos = %client.player.getPosition();

    //Add an offset to that position. For simplicity,
    //we're just adding a fixed number and we're
    //not checking if the position is accessible.
    %pos = vectorAdd(%pos, "2 2 0");

    //Call the AI spawning function.
    AIPlayer::spawnAtPosition(%pos, "TutPet");
}
//UAISK Pet: End

	<h3>
		In the last part of the last line in the step above, you may have noticed it says "TutPet". "TutPet" is the name of the datablock
		that our pet will use when it's spawned. So now we have to make that datablock.<br>
		<br>
		File- scripts/server/UAISK/aiDatablocks.cs<br>
		After the default AI datablock, which looks like the following:<br>
	</h3>
	<pre>
datablock PlayerData(DefaultPlayer : DefaultPlayerData)
{
   shapeFile = "art/shapes/actors/gideon/gideon.dts";

   //All values can be commented out if you wish
   //If you get rid of them, the bot will just use the same values as the player

   maxDamage = 100;
   maxForwardSpeed = 14;
   maxBackwardSpeed = 13;
   maxSideSpeed = 13;

   //AI specific values that can be set for this datablock
   //These values can be overridden by the spawn marker,
   //but these values override the defaults

   spawnGroup = 1;
   fov = 200;
   leash = 35;
   cycleCounter = "5";
   weaponMode = "pattern";
   activeDodge = 1;
   team = 2;
   realName = "Bot";
};

//UAISK Pet: Start
datablock PlayerData(TutPet : DefaultPlayerData)
{
   //AI specific values that can be set for this datablock.
   //We're using the minimum amount of settings that are needed to do what we want to do.
   behavior = "PetBehavior";
   respawn = false;
   team = 1;
};
//UAISK Pet: End
</pre>
	<h3>
		In the first line of the above code, you may notice that it says "TutPet" whereas the default datablock has "DefaultPlayer" in
		that location. This is the name of our datablock. <a href="./Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction18" target="_top">Check here</a>

	<h3>
		After doing the steps above, you can already load a game and press the "j" key to spawn a pet. If you tried to do that, you may
		have noticed that you can keep pressing it to spawn more and more pets. Now we're going to put a limit on the number of pets
		you can spawn.<br>
		<br>
		File- scripts/server/commands.cs<br>
		Within the serverCmdSpawningAIPetHere() function we added earlier, change the following:<br>
	</h3>

    //Call the AI spawning function.
    AIPlayer::spawnAtPosition(%pos, "TutPet");
</pre>
	<h3>
		To:<br>
