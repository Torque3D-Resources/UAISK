	<h1>
		Getting Started Guide:</h1>
	<h3>
		<p>
			Needless to say, I highly recommend following all of the instructions listed here. Even if you have years of programming experience
			in general or with Torque, I still do not recommend skipping any steps. Even the best of us still make mistakes, but these instructions
			are here to help you minimize them and grow accustom to the way that The Universal AI Starter Kit works.
		</p>
		<p>
			After reading this document, if you have any other questions at all, check the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction29">
				FAQs</a> section. You may also want to read the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction1">UAISK Overview</a> section.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even if you are planning to add The UAISK to an existing project, I would still recommend that you create a new project and do
			a quick install to get a feel for what the kit can do and how it works.
		</p>
	</h3>
	<h3>
		<p>
			To perform a quick install, simply replace the stock Torque files with the files that came with this kit. The file structure
			should remain the same. However, if you are not using the exact engine number listed above, you will need to do a custom install instead.
		</p>
		<p>
			After you have done a quick install in a new project, open a mission in that project and press "alt a" to open the AI Marker
			Editor. Read the text and tooltips within the editor and you should have your AI up and running in no time. If you need additional
			instructions, check the <a href="Usage_Instructions.html">Usage Instructions</a> and the <a href="http://vimeo.com/7226158">
				Video Tutorial</a>. Note: The video tutorial was made using an older version of the kit and portions of it are now out of date.
		</p>
		<p>
			After doing a quick install to test things out, if you'd then like to install the kit into a preexisting project, check the
			<a href="T3D_Install_Instructions.html">T3D Installation Instructions</a>. Make sure to do every step.
		</p>
	</h3>
	<h3>
		<p>
			After you have tested the kit by itself and done a custom install to your existing project if needed, the next thing I would
			recommend is to try out one or both of the tutorials that come with the kit (although not at the same time); the <a href="Pet_Tutorial.html">
				Pet Tutorial</a> and the <a href="Team_Tutorial.html">Team Tutorial</a>. The tutorials are designed help you
			understand some of the ways in which the stock features of The UAISK can be used to build or enhance your project's game specific
			functionality. Because of this, having some basic knowledge of TorqueScript (or at least knowledge of a C like language) is helpful
			to get the most out of the tutorials. If you're not really a programmer and are more of the artist type, you'll likely want to
			know about <a href="Usage_Instructions.html#Instruction18">Adding New Characters</a>. But I would still recommend
			that even artists and designers try the <a href="Pet_Tutorial.html">Pet Tutorial</a>, which is the easier of the two.
		</p>
		<p>
			At this point, if you like <a href="https://github.com/faustlogic/Torque3D-plus-AFX">Arcane-FX 2</a> you may want to look at the separate
			files to allow interoperability between The UAISK with AFX2.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're not familiar with TorqueScript but would like to learn about it, I'd suggest looking at the
			<a href="http://www.garagegames.com/documentation/torque-3d">Official Torque Documentation</a>. If you haven't learned about how to program in a C
			like language yet, I'd suggest looking for a more general tutorial that starts from the ground up. You should do an internet search for basic C++ or C# tutorials.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you get to the point of wanting to add in your own custom art and code, carefully read the related <a href="Usage_Instructions.html">
				Usage Instructions</a> and code comments to help you. But before you go and start coding major new features from scratch,
			I'd suggest looking for code that already does what you would like or code that you could use as a base and modify. The kit has
			many versatile functions buried within the code that you may find helpful, such as math and level loading related functions.
			If the kit doesn't have similar code to what you want to do, try doing a <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/community/search">Resource
				Search</a> on GarageGames.com. There are lots of great, free, community made resources out there for almost anything you
			could think of. And as I said, it doesn't have to do exactly the same thing that you want; anything that can be used as a base
			will give you a head start.
		</p>
		<p>
			By taking some time and exploring all of the different aspects of the kit, you will find many new ways to bring a sense of fun
			and excitement to your gaming project.
